### Face Recognition using FaceNet
In this project, a face detection system was developed using the [FaceNet model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pwQ3H4aJ8a6yyJHZkTwtjcL4wYWQb7bn), a deep convulutional neural network  which extracts high-quality features from the face and predicts a 128 element vector representation of the features known as a face embedding. Two models (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) were trained on images of faces of the following individuals:
- Elon Musk
- Mark Zuckerberg
- Jeff Bezos
- Bill Gates

The test images used in this project were collected manually from Google Images.
